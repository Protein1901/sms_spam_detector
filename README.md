## Acknowledgments

- **Code Source:**  
  Most of the code was adapted from Bootcamp course material, while some portions of the code in this repository were provided with guidance and assistance online. 

- **Location of sourced code:**  
  The sourced code is primarily located within the `gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb` notebook, specifically in the sections:
  - Loading and preprocessing of the CSV data.
  - Defining the SMS classification and prediction functions.
  - Implementation of the Gradio interface for SMS spam detection.

This acknowledgment serves as a means of transparency for grading staff to clearly distinguish between external assistance and original contributions.
